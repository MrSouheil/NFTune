One main\r\n *  difference is how it handles consistency. The polling providers\r\n *  will stall responses to ensure a consistent state, while this\r\n *  WebSocket provider assumes the connected backend will manage this.\r\n *\r\n *  For example, if a polling provider emits an event which indicates\r\n *  the event occurred in blockhash XXX, a call to fetch that block by\r\n *  its hash XXX, if not present will retry until it is present. This\r\n *  can occur when querying a pool of nodes that are mildly out of sync\r\n *  with each other.\r\n */\r\n\r\nlet NextId = 1;\r\n\r\nexport type InflightRequest = {\r\n     callback: (error: Error, result: any) => void;\r\n     payload: string;\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport type Subscription = {\r\n    tag: string;\r\n    processFunc: (payload: any) => void;\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport interface WebSocketLike {\r\n    onopen: ((...args: Array<any>) => any) | null;\r\n    onmessage: ((...args: Array<any>) => any) | null;\r\n    onerror: ((...args: Array<any>) => any) | null;\r\n\r\n    readyState: number;\r\n\r\n    send(payload: any): void;\r\n    close(code?: number, reason?: string): void;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// For more info about the Real-time Event API see:\r\n//   https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/pubsub\r\n\r\nexport class WebSocketProvider extends JsonRpcProvider {\r\n    readonly _websocket: any;\r\n    readonly _requests: { [ name: string ]: InflightRequest };\r\n    readonly _detectNetwork: Promise<Network>;\r\n\r\n    // Maps event tag to subscription ID (we dedupe identical events)\r\n    readonly _subIds: { [ tag: string ]: Promise<string> };\r\n\r\n    // Maps Subscription ID to Subscription\r\n    readonly _subs: { [ name: string ]: Subscription };\r\n\r\n    _wsReady: boolean;\r\n\r\n    constructor(url: string | WebSocketLike, network?: Networkish) {\r\n\r\n        // This will be added in the future;
